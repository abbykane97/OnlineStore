# Project Title

## Description of the Project

I created an online store application that allowed users to shop for products, filtering by department, ID number, Department, Price and Product Name.

Briefly describe what this Java console application does. Mention its purpose and who the intended users are. Explain the main functionality and what problems it aims to solve.

## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."
As a user I want my shoppers to be able to locate their items quickly and most efficiently.

- As a user, I want to be able to input my data, so that the application can process it accordingly.
- As a user, I want to receive immediate feedback, so I can understand what to do next.

## Setup
nstall IntelliJ IDEA: If you haven't already, download and install IntelliJ IDEA from the JetBrains website. You can choose the Community (free) or Ultimate (paid) edition based on your needs.

Open IntelliJ IDEA: Once installed, open IntelliJ IDEA on your computer.

Create a New Project or Open an Existing Project:
To create a new project, select "Create New Project" from the welcome screen. Choose the project type (e.g., Java, Python, etc.) and configure the project settings.
To open an existing project, select "Open" from the welcome screen or go to "File" > "Open" and navigate to the project directory.

Configure Project Settings:
If you're creating a new project, you'll need to configure the project settings such as the project SDK (Java Development Kit) version and project name.
If you're opening an existing project, ensure that the project SDK is configured correctly by going to "File" > "Project Structure" > "Project" and selecting the appropriate JDK.
Set Up Dependencies (if applicable): If your project depends on external libraries or frameworks, you'll need to add them as dependencies. This can be done using Maven, Gradle, or manually by adding JAR files to your project's classpath.

Write Code: Once the project is set up, you can start writing code. Create classes, methods, and other necessary components for your project.
Build the Project: Before running the project, it's a good practice to build it to ensure that there are no compilation errors. You can build the project by selecting "Build" > "Build Project" from the menu bar or pressing Ctrl + F9 (Cmd + F9 on Mac).

Run the Project:
To run the project, find the main class (the class with the main method) in your project structure.
Right-click on the main class file and select "Run <class-name>" from the context menu.
Alternatively, you can use the green "Run" button in the toolbar at the top of the IntelliJ IDEA window.

View Output: If your project produces any output (e.g., print statements), you can view it in the "Run" or "Debug" tool window at the bottom of the IntelliJ IDEA window.


Instructions on how to set up and run the project using IntelliJ IDEA.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, which you can download [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
Make sure you have Java SDK 17 installed and configured in intelliJ.

- IntelliJ IDEA: Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, which you can download from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

### Running the Application in IntelliJ

Follow these steps to get your application running within IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select "Open" and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the project.
3. After the project opens, wait for IntelliJ to index the files and set up the project.
4. Find the main class with the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
5. Right-click on the file and select 'Run 'YourMainClassName.main()'' to start the application.
